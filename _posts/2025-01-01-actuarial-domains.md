### Summary

Actuarial work can be classified along **two axes**:

1. **Business Line** – the type of insurance, pension, or financial product being worked on.  
2. **Functional Area** – the type of actuarial work performed (reserving, pricing, ALM, etc.).  

A professional actuary may specialize in one business line (e.g., Life Insurance) but work across multiple functional domains (e.g., reserving, pricing, ALM).
