Welcome to **The Actuarial Journal** — a structured knowledge hub dedicated to explaining actuarial science in a clear, practical, and accessible manner.

This journal is created for:

- Actuarial students and exam aspirants  
- Early-career actuarial professionals

> Actuarial science is not about complex mathematics alone —  
> it is about understanding uncertainty and making responsible financial decisions.
